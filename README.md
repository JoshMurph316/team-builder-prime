# Team Builder v2

## Overview
The **Team Builder v2** application is a web-based tool designed for creating, managing, and optimizing character teams based on **Marvel Strike Force (MSF)** characters. Users can select characters, view their attributes, and build teams with features like **character synergies** and **advanced filtering options**.

This version of the app is built using **Angular 14+** and is hosted on **Firebase**. It integrates **character data** fetched through **web scraping**, and allows saving and retrieving team configurations from **Firebase Firestore**.

## Features
- **Character Selection & Team Building**: Users can add/remove characters from a staging area to build teams.
- **Character Synergy Suggestions**: The app suggests complementary characters based on attributes such as abilities and tags.
- **Search & Filtering**: Advanced search and filter by character attributes, including clickable tags (e.g., "taunt") for dynamic filtering.
- **Save Teams to Firestore**: User-created teams can be saved for future sessions.
- **Mobile-Friendly UI**: Optimized for smaller screens with collapsible sections and a responsive layout.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (v6 or higher)
- **Angular CLI** (v13 or higher)
- **Firebase CLI** (v9 or higher)
- **Python** (for scraping data)

## Setting Up the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/team-builder-v2.git
cd team-builder-v2
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Firebase Setup
To configure Firebase for the application:

- Create a **Firebase Project** in the Firebase Console.
- Enable **Firestore** and **Firebase Hosting**.
- Download the Firebase configuration file for your project and update the environment files:

In `src/environments/environment.ts` and `src/environments/environment.prod.ts`, update with your Firebase projectâ€™s config:

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  firebaseConfig: {
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    authDomain: 'YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN',
    projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
    storageBucket: 'YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET',
    messagingSenderId: 'YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID',
    appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
    measurementId: 'YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID',
  },
};
```

### 4. Install Angular Fire & Angular Material
Add Angular Fire and Angular Material to the project:

```bash
ng add @angular/fire
ng add @angular/material
```

Choose a Material theme during the installation.

### 5. Modify `angular.json` for Firebase Hosting
Ensure your `angular.json` has the correct Firebase hosting configuration:

```json
"architect": {
  "build": {
    "options": {
      "outputPath": "dist/team-builder-v2",
      "firebase": "firebase.json"
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. Initialize Firebase Hosting
Run the following command to set up Firebase Hosting:

```bash
firebase init
```

Select **Hosting** and configure it with the default Firebase project. Set the public directory to `dist/team-builder-v2`.

### 7. Build the Application
Build the app for production:

```bash
ng build --prod
```

### 8. Deploy to Firebase Hosting
Deploy the app to Firebase Hosting:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

## Data Pipeline (Python-based Scraper)

### 9. Set up the Web Scraper
The `iso_scrapper.py` script scrapes character data from a Marvel site and stores it as JSON in Firebase.

- Install the required Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

- Ensure you have **Chromedriver** installed for Selenium.

- Run the scraper:

```bash
python data/iso_scrapper.py --max-pages 2
```

This will scrape the data and save it as `iso_data.json`.

### 10. Upload Scraped Data to Firestore
Upload the scraped data (`iso_data.json`) to Firebase Firestore manually or automate this using a Firebase SDK script.

## Connecting Data to Angular Application

### 11. Create Character Service
Generate a service to fetch data from Firestore:

```bash
ng generate service services/character
```

**Updated `character.service.ts`**:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { AngularFirestore } from '@angular/fire/compat/firestore';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class CharacterService {
  constructor(private firestore: AngularFirestore) {}

  // Fetch characters from Firestore
  getCharacters(): Observable<any> {
    return this.firestore.collection('characters').valueChanges();
  }
}
```

Use this service in your components to load and display character data.

## Development Server

To start the local development server:

```bash
ng serve
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload when you modify any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Generate a new component:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For more available schematics, run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project:

```bash
ng build
```

This will create the production-ready files in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Unit Tests

Execute unit tests with Karma:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running End-to-End Tests

For end-to-end testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

## Troubleshooting and Modifications

- **Firebase Configuration Issues**: Ensure your Firebase config keys in `environment.ts` are correct.
- **Data Not Displaying**: Verify that your Firestore data exists and is structured correctly.
- **Service Fetching Issues**: Confirm that the Angular service is correctly fetching data from Firestore and binding it to the UI components.
